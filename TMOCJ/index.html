    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>Carl Jr. (CJ) has become a misfit. His unorthodox behavior has left him unable to relate to people. He lives with his aunt, and likens their relationship to the “Hippopotamus and the Oxpecker”, although he’s not sure who’s who. His only place of solace has become a homeless camp living near an abandoned rail line. The group has always welcomed CJ without question, but after an explosive rant from one of the camp’s leaders, CJ is forced to look back at the event that led them all three in the first place.</p>

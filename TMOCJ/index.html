        <h3>Dylan Osean</h3>
        <p>Carl Jr.</p>
        <p>Dylan currently works two delivery jobs in Los Angeles county. Monday through Friday, he caters lunches for a company based out of Burbank. Every morning he calls Luis, a quiet but dedicated co-worker, who informs Dylan where and to who he’ll be catering that day. On weekends, Dylan shifts gears and works evenings at a local restaurant near his home. The people are nice and the deliveries are steady, but not everything that shines is a diamond. Talk radio tends to repeat itself, and the smell of hot food from the passenger seat can cause hunger pains. After each shift, frustrated and tired, Dylan returns home where the search for parking continues. Nevertheless, both jobs are flexible and have given Dylan enough time to write, direct, act, edit, and score The Misunderstanding of Carl Jr.</p>

        <h3>Cheryl Ladd</h3>
        <p>Allyson</p>
        <p>Since her big break as one of the beloved “Charlie’s Angels,” Cheryl Ladd has enjoyed a career that has traversed television, film, Broadway and beyond.

  2016 saw Ladd starring in FX’s “American Crime Story: The People V. O.J. Simpson” playing Linell Shapiro, the wife of Simpson’s defense attorney Robert Shapiro (portrayed by John Travolta). 2017 we will see her in the Warner Brother’s upcoming feature film To Have and To Hold opposite Katherine Heigl and the indie feature Camera Store opposite John Larroquette and John Rhys-Davies.

  In 2015, Ladd guest starred on Showtime’s hit “Ray Donovan,” FX’s “Anger Management,” the Hallmark Channel movie “Garage Sale Mysteries: The Wedding Dress” and the faith-based film The Perfect Wave, starring Ladd in a lead role opposite Scott Eastwood. Her other recent credits include Ladd singing and dancing as ‘Mrs. Claus’ in the Disney musical The Search for Santa Paws: Santa Pups 2, as well as starring as an unhinged love interest to medical examiner ‘Ducky’ (David McCallum) on television’s #1 rated drama, “NCIS.”

  Moving effortlessly between mediums has always been second nature for Ladd, and the seasoned performer demonstrated such versatility when she starred as ‘Annie Oakley’ in “Annie Get Your Gun!” on Broadway, realizing a lifelong dream.

  Cheryl is an ambassador for Childhelp - one of the largest national non-profit organizations dedicated to the research, prevention and treatment of child abuse.  Every January, Ladd teams with actor John O’Hurley to host a celebrity golf tournament to raise funds and awareness for Childhelp.

  An avid golfer with a respectable index of 14, she authored Token Chick: A Woman’s Guide to Golfing with the Boys in 2006, an autobiographical book recounting her experiences in the sport of golf.

  Born and raised in Huron, South Dakota, Ladd moved to L.A. intent on pursuing her dream of becoming an actress.  In just a short time, she got her first professional break as the singing voice of 'Melody' on the cartoon series, "Josie and the Pussycats."  Ladd quickly added a string of significant credits to her resume, including the comedy/variety series, "The Ken Berry WOW Show," with Steve Martin and Teri Garr.  Ladd was then cast in the role of 'Kris Munroe' on "Charlie's Angels" and was instantly catapulted into stardom over her four years on the show.

  While still on the series, she developed and starred in the ABC telefilm, “When She Was Bad," which dealt with the harsh realities of child abuse.  Ladd's numerous other credits include guest star roles on sitcoms as the love interest to Martin Sheen in Charlie Sheen’s in  “Anger Management,”  “Hope and Faith,” “Jesse” and a recurring role on “Two Guys and a Girl.” Feature film credits include Baggage with Barry Bostwick, A Dog of Flanders opposite Jon Voight, Permanent Midnight with Ben Stiller, Poison Ivy with Tom Skerritt and Drew Barrymore.</p>
